## Description

Nirmali, a married Paediatrician in her late 30s, leads a peaceful but joyless domestic existence in Guwahati, Assam. Her husband, a senior Doctor, spends most of his time doing relief work in surrounding areas, leaving her alone at home to take care of their son. One day, she meets Suman, a young PhD student researching food habits in northeastern India, who warms up to her in a manner she seems unaccustomed to. Suman's work exposes him to the belief that there's no kind of food that can be considered abnormal, and Nirmali is drawn to this idea. The two quickly discover that they have a shared love for food - specifically, meat. Together, they bond over meals comprising unusual meats on platonic dates, although Suman longs for some sort of physical contact. As Nirmali's tastebuds grow more adventurous, their relationship takes a dark and bizarre turn.

We hope to publish the soundtrack to all streaming sites soon!
